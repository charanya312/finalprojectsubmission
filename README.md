To begin, I loaded the dataset from the "Get Data" tab. The main objective was to create an interactive dashboard. First, I selected a theme from the "View" tabâ€”choosing the Executive theme for a professional look. I then added a Text Box from the "Home" tab to include a title, applying formatting such as bold text, custom font size, and color to enhance its appearance. Next, I created Cards to display key metrics like the number of buildings and the average energy consumption. To visualize the data effectively, I used various chart types: Bar Chart: showing the relationship between Building and City.

Stacked Column Chart: illustrating the City against the sum of electricity consumption.

Stacked Area Chart: for observing consumption trends over time or categories.

Waterfall Chart: representing the City and the sum of all types of consumption to analyze contribution and variation.

For each visual, I used the Format Your Visual pane to customize elements such as titles, axis labels (X and Y), colors, and legends. In this way, I successfully built a comprehensive dashboard and analyzed the dataset through multiple visualizations.
In page3 I used table visualization  to view entire database and I also add navigation to navigate from one page to other page.
